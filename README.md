## Folderpeek - Preview folders, 7z<sup> ([7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/7z.html) required)</sup>, txt files
**Folderpeek** is a tiny utility that extends Windows' File Explorer. Launch it and you'll gain the ability to see inside folders (and more) without opening them.

![Demo](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/blob/fe198304156ccfb4e8f046661404a69f7520636e/folderpeek_demo.gif?raw=true)


**Newbie? →** click to download [**folderpeek.exe**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v3/folderpeek_v3.exe), then open it. The program will stay on, you will see its icon in the tray. 

**Wanna customize? →** download [**folderpeek.ahk**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v3/folderpeek_v3.ahk) (requires [AHK v2](https://www.autohotkey.com))

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  I'm a newbie developer, this little program doesn't work with *every* folder, I'm not able to make it work with some default folders like `Documents`, and also the preview doesn't appear reliably when the list is higher than the screen height.<br/>
> Currently *most* folders are shown reliably, and the program should not crash or cause issues.

**Feedback and help** are very welcome!
