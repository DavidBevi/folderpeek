## Folderpeek - an AutoHotkey v2 script
Preview the contents of any folder in File Explorer

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/refs/heads/main/folderpeek_demo.gif)

### A little explanation for newbies
To make it work you need to lauch a tiny program that will stay on, until you go in the tray and close it.
Chose one:
* install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com) and then download + launch [**folderpeek.ah**k](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v1/folderpeek_v1.ahk)
* download + launch [**folderpeek.exe**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v1/folderpeek_v1.exe)
