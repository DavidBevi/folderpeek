## Folderpeek - an AutoHotkey v2 script
Preview the contents of most folders in File Explorer, when you move the mouse over it.

![Demo](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/blob/fe198304156ccfb4e8f046661404a69f7520636e/folderpeek_demo.gif?raw=true)

**Newbie? →** click to download [![icon](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/blob/main/folderpeek_icon.png?raw=true) **folderpeek.exe**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v2/folderpeek_v2.exe), then open it. The program will stay on, you will see its icon in the tray. 

**Wanna customize? →** download [**folderpeek.ahk**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/folderpeek/releases/download/v2.0.1/folderpeek_v2.0.1.ahk) (requires [AHK v2](https://www.autohotkey.com))

**Disclaimer**: I'm a newbie developer, this little program doesn't work with *every* folder, I'm not able to make it work with some default folders like `Documents`, and also the preview doesn't appear reliably when the list is higher than the screen height.<br/>
Currently *most* folders are shown reliably, and the program should not crash or cause issues.

**Feedback and help** are very welcome!
